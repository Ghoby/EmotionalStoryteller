Maria: Every conceiveable constellation was there for the eye to see.
<<Nod Joao Start>>
Maria: The S shape of the Old Drake;
Maria: The broken arch of Glundun's Lyre;
<<Nod Joao Stop>>
Maria: The confused, mishmash pattern of dots that made the Fire Bull;

Joao: The blood trail she was following led to an enormous cave.
Joao: It's entrance, a wide-open mouth of dark gloom ripping out of the body of the hill's wall,
Joao: broken and sharp stalactite and stalagmite fangs in wait of any entering prey. 
Joao: Grabbing a broken oak branch from the surrounding treeline, she took a bundle of dead leaves,
Joao: wrapped them around one of the branch's ends with some linen cloth soaked in old licor and,

Maria: She came to a point where the cave became slightly wider, and the ceiling much taller, 
<<Nod Joao Stop>>
Maria: so much so, that the light of her torch couldn't even reach it.

Maria: As her chest tightned, she drew Sear.
<<Nod Joao Start>>
Maria: Any sign of shifting movement, any slight noise at the edge of earing, 
Maria: any wiff of decayed flesh, any pair of eyes glowing in the midst of the gloom,
<<Nod Joao Stop>>
Maria: her senses and muscles were ready to receive and respond, accordingly.

Maria: both screaming silently for her blood and flesh.
Maria: She wasn't surprised.

Joao: Her left shoulder was dislocated, so she couldn't move the arm dangling underneath it.
<<Nod Maria Stop>>
