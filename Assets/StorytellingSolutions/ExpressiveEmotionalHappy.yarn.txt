<<OBJECTIVE:0.0; Calm:0.3>>
Maria: The sky, completely stripped of clouds, flourished with glistening stars.
Maria: Every conceiveable constellation was there for the eye to see.
Maria: The S shape of the Old Drake;
Maria: The broken arch of Glundun's Lyre;
Maria: The confused, mishmash pattern of dots that made the Fire Bull;
<<Nod Joao Start>>
Maria: Kali watched them all from her little improvised camp,
Maria: right beneath a clearing in the low treetops of Salazar's Woods.
<<Nod Joao Stop>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.0; Calm:0.5>>
Maria: She found herself happily grinning upwards,
Maria: remembering her last days on the village, before coming here.
<<OBJECTIVE:0.2; Calm:0.5>>
<<Nod Joao Start>>
Maria: Then, with a stronger arm than before,
Maria: she proceded with the sharpening of the blade.
<<Nod Joao Stop>>

<<wait 3>>

Maria: This would be her first solitary venture into the wilds.
Maria: Ganji, her master, insisted that she should do this by herself.
<<OBJECTIVE:0.0; Calm:0.7>>
Maria: "You're much too experienced to have this bag of old meat protecting you,"
Maria: was the last thing he said to her before she departed,
<<Nod Joao Start>>
Maria: and before that he gifted her with his sword Sear,
Maria: named for the simmering heat its blade generated when swung or thrusted.
<<Nod Joao Stop>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.1; Calm:0.7>>
Maria: And tomorrow, Kali would hopefully put it to good use.
Maria: She had been following Its trail for more than a day now.
Maria: Sooner or later, it would end.
Maria: When she was done with the blade, she carefully placed it in its sheath,
<<Nod Joao Start>>
Maria: and layed on her makeshift matress of leaves and moss, using her pack as a pillow.
Maria: "Tomorrow..." she remembered saying to herself as she fell asleep,
<<Nod Joao Stop>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.1; Calm:0.8>>
Maria: "tomorrow, you're dead."

<<wait 3>>

Maria: The torch's light was enough for her to get her imediate bearings inside the cave,
Maria: but it also blinded Kali's eyes to the void outside the ring of light, 
<<Nod Joao Start>>
Maria: which, at times, seemed almost alive with thought and tentacle motion.
<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Maria Sadness 0.5 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.1; Calm:-0.6>>
Joao: Some years before, with Genji still carefully watching over her,
<<Nod Joao Stop>>
Joao: they hunted a highly vicious nightcrawler that hid himself in a cave not unlike this one.
Joao: They knew what it was capable of, having seen some of the gore it left on its bloody wake.
Joao: But they caught it. And they killed it. The dark couldn't protect him from Sear.
Joao: In the village, they were received with tremendous celebration and rejoice.
Joao: They even brought out some of the leftover fireworks from New Year's Celebration,
<<Nod Maria Start>>
Joao: and fired them up into the stars. 
Joao: That was one of the happiest nights of Kali's life.
<<Nod Maria Stop>>
<<Feel Joao Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Joao Surprise 0.5 None>>
<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.1; Calm:-0.1>>
Maria: Kali smilled at the thought,
<<Nod Joao Start>>
Maria: and the looming darkness felt like it had lost some of its initial weight.
Maria: She walked on, blood trail still underneath her heels.
<<Nod Joao Stop>>

<<wait 3>>

Maria: She came to a point where the cave became slightly wider, and the ceiling much taller, 
Maria: so much so, that the light of her torch couldn't even reach it.
<<Feel Joao Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Maria Happiness 0.6 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.3; Calm:-0.4>>
Maria: As her chest tightned, she drew Sear.
<<Nod Joao Start>>
Maria: Any sign of shifting movement, any slight noise at the edge of earing, 
Maria: any wiff of decayed flesh, any pair of eyes glowing in the midst of the gloom,
<<Nod Joao Stop>>
Maria: her senses and muscles were ready to receive and respond, accordingly.
<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.3; Calm:-0.5>>
Joao: The trail ended abruptly.
<<Nod Maria Start>>
Joao: As if in one moment the blood was steadily falling to the ground,
Joao: and in another it had suddenly stopped.
<<Nod Maria Stop>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.3; Calm:-0.7>>
Joao: A deep, guttural snarl, almost mocking in tone, came from behind her.
Joao: And when she turned around, she saw Its two slitted yellow eyes,
Joao: both screaming silently for her blood and flesh.
Joao: She wasn't surprised.

<<wait 3>>

<<Nod Maria Start>>
Joao: Kali couldn't say if this rush of attacks had lasted 2 minutes or 2 hours.
<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Maria Sadness 0.5 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.0; Calm:-0.9>>
Joao: When It stopped, Kali had the the entirety of her coat and trousers ripped and bloodied.
<<Nod Maria Stop>>
Joao: Her left shoulder was dislocated, so she couldn't move the arm dangling underneath it.
Joao: Sear was still in her right hand, though. The torch she held in her teeth.
Joao: But she knew her body couldn't take much more of this.
<<Feel Joao Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Joao Surprise 0.5 None>>
<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Maria Happiness 0.6 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.5; Calm:0.0>>
<<Nod Joao Start>>
Maria: "Last chance," she thought to herself.
Maria: And with all of her strength and will pulling for her body, she charged at It.
<<Nod Joao Stop>>
Maria: Responding in tandem, It also charged at her in a bestial, galloping motion.
<<Feel Joao Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Joao Fear 0.3 None>>
<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.0; Calm:0.0>>
Joao: It was now or never.
Joao: Do or die.
