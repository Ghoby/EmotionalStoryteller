Maria: This would be her first solitary venture into the wilds.
Maria: Ganji, her master, insisted that she should do this by herself.

Maria: "You're much too experienced to have this bag of old meat protecting you,"
Maria: was the last thing he said to her before she departed,
Maria: and then he gifted her with his sword Sear,
Maria: named for the simmering heat its blade generated when swung or thrusted.
<<OBJECTIVE:0.2; Calm:0.7>>
<<Nod Joao Start>>
Maria: Tomorrow, Kali would hopefully put it to good use.
Maria: She had been following Its trail for more than a day now.
<<Nod Joao Stop>>
Maria: Sooner or later, it would end.
Maria: When she was done with the blade, she carefully placed it in its sheath,
<<Nod Joao Start>>
Maria: and layed on her makeshift mattress of leaves and moss, using her pack as a pillow.
Maria: "Tomorrow..." she remembered saying to herself as she fell asleep,
<<Nod Joao Stop>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.2; Calm:0.8>>
Joao: "tomorrow, you're dead."

Joao: The torch's light was enough for her to get her immediate bearings inside the cave,
Joao: but it also blinded Kali's eyes to the void outside the ring of light, 
Joao: which, at times, seemed almost alive with shifting thought and tentacle motion.
<<Nod Maria Start>>
Joao: Some years before, with Genji still carefully watching over her,
Joao: they hunted a highly vicious nightcrawler that hid himself in a cave not unlike this one.
<<Nod Maria Stop>>
Joao: They knew what it was capable of, having seen some of the gore it left in its wake.
Joao: But they caught and killed it. The dark couldn't protect him from Sear.
Joao: In the village, they were received with tremendous celebration and rejoice.
Joao: They even brought out some of the leftover fireworks from New Year's Celebration,
<<Nod Maria Start>>
Joao: and fired them up into the stars. 
Joao: That was one of the happiest nights of Kali's life.

Maria: Kali smiled at the thought,
Maria: and the looming darkness felt like it had lost some of its initial weight on her.
Maria: She walked on, blood trail still underneath her heels.

Maria: She came to a point where the cave became slightly wider, and the ceiling much taller, 
<<Nod Joao Start>>
Maria: so much so, that the light of her torch couldn't even reach it.

Joao: As her chest tightened, she drew Sear.
<<Nod Joao Stop>>
Joao: Any sign of shifting movement, any slight noise at the edge of earing, 
Joao: any whiff of decayed flesh, any pair of eyes glowing in the midst of the gloom,
Joao: her senses and muscles were ready to respond accordingly.
<<OBJECTIVE:0.3; Calm:-0.3>>
Joao: The trail ended abruptly.
Joao: As if in one moment the blood was steadily falling to the ground,
<<Nod Maria Start>>
Joao: and in another it had suddenly been cut off.
<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.3; Calm:-0.7>>
Joao: A deep, guttural snarl, almost mocking in tone, came from behind her.
<<Nod Maria Stop>>
Joao: And when she turned around, she saw Its two slitted yellow eyes,
Joao: both screaming silently for her blood and flesh.
<<Nod Maria Start>>
Joao: She wasn't surprised.
<<Nod Maria Stop>>

Joao: When It stopped, Kali had the the entirety of her coat and trousers ripped and bloodied.
Joao: Her left shoulder was dislocated, so she couldn't move the arm dangling underneath it.
Joao: Sear was still in her right hand, though. The torch she held in her teeth.
Joao: But she knew her body couldn't take much more of this.

Maria: "Last chance," she thought to herself.
Maria: And with all of her remaining strength and will pulling for her body, she charged at It.
<<Nod Joao Stop>>
Maria: Responding in tandem, It also charged at her in a bestial, galloping motion.
