Joao: The sky, completely stripped of clouds, flourished with glistening stars.
Joao: Every conceiveable constellation was there for the eye to see.
Joao: The S shape of the Old Drake;
Joao: The broken arch of Glundun's Lyre;
Joao: The confused, mishmash pattern of dots that made the Fire Bull;
<<Nod Maria Start>>
Joao: Kali watched them all from her little improvised camp,
Joao: right beneath a clearing in the low treetops of Salazar's Woods.

<<OBJECTIVE:-0.4; Calm:-0.2>>
Maria: The blood trail she was following led to an enormous cave.
Maria: It's entrance, a wide-open mouth of dark gloom ripping out of the body of the hill's wall,
Maria: broken and sharp stalactite and stalagmite fangs in wait of any entering prey. 
Maria: Grabbing a broken oak branch from the surrounding treeline, she took a bundle of dead leaves,
<<Nod Joao Start>>
Maria: wrapped them around one of the branch's ends with some linen cloth soaked in old licor and,
Maria: after unbuckling Sear, her blade, from its sheath, she waved it for a few seconds in the air
<<Nod Joao Stop>>

<<Feel Joao Surprise 0.5 None>>

<<OBJECTIVE:0.0; Calm:0.2>>
Maria: and pressed the scalding blade on the wet cloth. It caught fire instantly.
Maria: Now, the moment she feared, the moment she eagerly waited for, was at hand.
<<Nod Joao Start>>
Maria: Up-and-down shivers needled the skin of her back and neck.
Maria: Sweat filled the inside of her trembling leather gloves.
<<Nod Joao Stop>>
<<Feel Joao Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Maria Sadness 0.5 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.0; Calm:-0.2>>
Maria: Taking three deep breaths and a short prayer, she stepped into the darkness.

Joao: She came to a point where the cave became slightly wider, and the ceiling much taller, 
Joao: so much so, that the light of her torch couldn't even reach it.
<<Feel Joao Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Maria Happiness 0.6 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.3; Calm:-0.4>>
Joao: As her chest tightned, she drew Sear.
Joao: Any sign of shifting movement, any slight noise at the edge of earing, 
<<Nod Maria Start>>
Joao: any wiff of decayed flesh, any pair of eyes glowing in the midst of the gloom,
Joao: her senses and muscles were ready to receive and respond, accordingly.
<<Nod Maria Stop>>
<<Feel Joao Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.3; Calm:-0.5>>
Joao: The trail ended abruptly.
Joao: As if in one moment the blood was steadily falling to the ground,
Joao: and in another it had suddenly stopped.
<<Feel Joao Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.3; Calm:-0.7>>
Joao: A deep, guttural snarl, almost mocking in tone, came from behind her.
<<Nod Maria Start>>
Joao: And when she turned around, she saw Its two slitted yellow eyes,
Joao: both screaming silently for her blood and flesh.
<<Nod Maria Stop>>
Joao: She wasn't surprised.

<<OBJECTIVE:0.0; Calm:-0.9>>
Maria: When It stopped, Kali had the the entirety of her coat and trousers ripped and bloodied.
Maria: Her left shoulder was dislocated, so she couldn't move the arm dangling underneath it.
Maria: Sear was still in her right hand, though. The torch she held in her teeth.
<<Nod Joao Start>>
Maria: But she knew her body couldn't take much more of this.

Maria: "Last chance," she thought to herself.
<<Nod Joao Stop>>
Maria: And with all of her strength and will pulling for her body, she charged at It.
Maria: Responding in tandem, It also charged at her in a bestial, galloping motion.
