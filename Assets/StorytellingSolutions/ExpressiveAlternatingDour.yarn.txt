Maria: The blood trail she was following led to an enormous cave.
Maria: It's entrance, a wide-open mouth of dark gloom ripping out of the body of the hill's wall,
Maria: broken and sharp stalactite and stalagmite fangs in wait of any entering prey. 
Maria: Grabbing a broken oak branch from the surrounding treeline, she took a bundle of dead leaves,
Maria: wrapped them around one of the branch's ends with some linen cloth soaked in old licor and,
Maria: after unbuckling Sear, her blade, from its sheath, she waved it for a few seconds in the air

Maria: and pressed the scalding blade on the wet cloth. It caught fire instantly.
Maria: Now, the moment she feared, the moment she eagerly waited for, was at hand.
Maria: Up-and-down shivers needled the skin of her back and neck.
Maria: Sweat filled the inside of her trembling leather gloves.

<<OBJECTIVE:0.0; Calm:-0.2>>
Maria: Taking three deep breaths and a short prayer, she stepped into the darkness.

Joao: The torch's light was enough for her to get her imediate bearings,
Joao: but it also blinded Kali's eyes to the void outside the ring of light, 
Joao: which, at times, seemed almost alive with thought and tentacle motion.

<<Feel Maria Sadness 0.8 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.1; Calm:-0.6>>
Joao: Some years before, with Genji still carefully watching over her,
Joao: they hunted a highly vicious nightcrawler that hid himself in a cave not unlike this one.
Joao: They knew what it was capable of, having seen some of the gore it left on its bloody wake.
Joao: But they caught it. And they killed it. The dark couldn't protect him from Sear.
Joao: In the village, they were received with tremendous celebration and rejoice.
Joao: They even brought out some of the leftover fireworks from New Year's Celebration,
Joao: and fired them up into the stars. 
Joao: That was one of the happiest nights of Kali's life.
<<Feel Joao Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.1; Calm:-0.1>>
Joao: Kali smilled at the thought,
Joao: and the looming darkness felt like it had lost some of its initial weight.
Joao: She walked on, blood trail still underneath her heels.

Maria: She came to a point where the cave became slightly wider, and the ceiling much taller, 
Maria: so much so, that the light of her torch couldn't even reach it.
<<Feel Joao Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Maria Happiness 0.8 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.3; Calm:-0.4>>
Maria: As her chest tightned, she drew Sear.
Maria: Any sign of shifting movement, any slight noise at the edge of earing, 
Maria: any wiff of decayed flesh, any pair of eyes glowing in the midst of the gloom,
Maria: her senses and muscles were ready to receive and respond, accordingly.
<<Feel Joao Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.3; Calm:-0.5>>
Maria: The trail ended abruptly.
Maria: As if in one moment the blood was steadily falling to the ground,
Maria: and in another it had suddenly stopped.
<<Feel Joao Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:0.3; Calm:-0.7>>
Maria: A deep, guttural snarl, almost mocking in tone, came from behind her.
Maria: And when she turned around, she saw Its two slitted yellow eyes,
Maria: both screaming silently for her blood and flesh.
Maria: She wasn't surprised.

Joao: She ran towards the Creature, swinging the blade Sear ahead of her,
Joao: and thrusted the blade into It, but the Thing swiftly dodged her attack,
Joao: and, with Its huge, bloated left arm, pounded her to the ground.

<<OBJECTIVE:-0.2; Calm:-0.5>>
Joao: Kali, all air suddenly rushing out of her chest, felt like she was hit by a battering ram.
Joao: As she regained her breath, she couldn't help but smell It.

<<Feel Joao Fear 0.6 None>>
<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>
<<Feel Maria Sadness 0.8 None>>
<<OBJECTIVE:-0.3; Calm:-0.7>>
Joao: A nausious reek, a mix of rotten flesh, bile and sulfur.
Joao: Sear still in hand, she picked up the dropped torch, its light weaker than before.
Joao: But it was enough for Kali to catch a glimpse of Its crimson filled, hairy snout, 
Joao: rows of brownish, sharp teeth adorning a hungry, devilish grin.

<<Feel Maria Neutral 0.8 None>>

<<OBJECTIVE:-0.4; Calm:-0.8>>
Joao: It jumped on her, swinging its arms and legs - dagger like claws in each - left and right, 
Joao: with Kali managing to dodge most of the incoming charge, but each time her blood was shed,
Joao: the horror, the fear inside her mind, spread further through her limbs.
Joao: And it was if the Thing felt revitelized, coming at her with greater and greater ferocity.

Maria: Kali couldn't say if this rush of attacks had lasted 2 minutes or 2 hours.

<<OBJECTIVE:0.0; Calm:-0.9>>
Maria: When It stopped, Kali had the the entirety of her coat and trousers ripped and bloodied.
Maria: Her left shoulder was dislocated, so she couldn't move the arm dangling underneath it.
Maria: Sear was still in her right hand, though. The torch she held in her teeth.
Maria: But she knew her body couldn't take much more of this.

<<OBJECTIVE:0.5; Calm:0.0>>
Maria: "Last chance," she thought to herself.
Maria: And with all of her strength and will pulling for her body, she charged at It.
Maria: Responding in tandem, It also charged at her in a bestial, galloping motion.
