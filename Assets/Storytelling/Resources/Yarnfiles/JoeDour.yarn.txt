Joao: It was friday afternoon,
Joao: and the Thirsty Dog bar was bursting with an excited buzz of cursing and laughter.
Joao: After an intense week of assignments, exams and classes,
Joao: many students felt the need for a bit of drunken comradery.
Joao: The one who was screaming and shouting the loudest of all was <b>Bruce</b>.
Maria: <b>Joe</b> and <b>Darius</b> were almost baffled by him.
Maria: Despite being the tallest of the three, and having an impressive athletic physique,
Maria: he was surprisingly prone to turn awkwardly shy and silent in public.
Joao: The "almost" in "almost baffled" comes from the fact that, for the past few days,
Joao: <b>Bruce</b> was acting in a completely different manner to his usual self,
Joao: so the present situation was just another example of it.
Joao: "And th-and then, and then, the guy and his girl, just like..." 
Joao: "Got run over by an invisible car!",
Joao: "AN! INVISIBLE! CAAAAAAAAAR!!!", 
Joao: <b>Bruce</b> shouted with an inebriated fascination, almost choking with laughing.
Joao: "They j-just spun through the air like Half-Life 2 ragdolls!"
Maria: "That Instagram video's fake, bruh,", inteviened <b>Darius</b>, 
Maria: albeit with genuine bemuzement clearly present in his face and voice.
Joao: "But, I mean, let's be honest here! It's a pretty decent fake out," 
Joao: <b>Joe</b> couldn't help pointing out.
Maria: "Yeah, those two that got hit must be hired mimes, or something,"
Maria: "to fly through the air because of an invisible car pfffft..."
Maria: And the three of them burst out laughing simultaneously.

Joao: As the clamour died down,
Joao: <b>Joe</b> felt truly relieved that the week was finally over.
Joao: The two exams he had in past five days were,
Joao: for a lack of a better term, an absolute pain to study for.
Joao: specially the one he did that very same day.
Joao: But now, he could finally get some decent shuteye, even if only for a couple of days.
Joao: Plus, he could finally be with Josie. 
Joao: That's what he was looking forward to the most.
Maria: Over the last two or so years, their relationship was probably the only thing 
Maria: that stopped him from drowning in the rocky waters of early adulthood life.
Maria: Too late into his college course did he realize that he wasn't an IT kind of guy,
Maria: that the perpetual flow of writing and rewriting code, when past its initial novelty,
Maria: was something that just dragged him into fits of physical and mental exhaustion.
Maria: And the relationship between him with his parents was, slowly but surely,
Maria: reaching a freezing point, the calls between him and them becoming noticeably shorter, 
Maria: and more and more infrequent.
Maria: But being with Josie...
Maria: Being with Josie really, truly, helped him feel at ease.
Maria: And the two of them would be spending the entirety of the following day together,
Maria: from breakfast until dusk.

Maria: "Hey, do you guys want anything else from the bar?", asked <b>Darius</b>.
Joao: "Nah, I'll pass," <b>Joe</b> said, breaking off his thoughts.
Joao: He was already three beers under and he didn't want to get anywhere beyond tipsy, that day.
Joao: Bruce, however, asked for another beer. It would be his seventh.
Joao: "I'm thirsty today", he said, and his mouth twisted into a grin that,
Joao: even according with his "brand new" persona, stroke <b>Joe</b> as uncharacteristically odd.
Maria: For the first time since they came into the Thirsty Dog, their table,
Maria: and the whole bar for that matter, fell into a sort of unusual quiet.
<<wait 5>>
Joao: "Joe, uhm..." said <b>Bruce</b>, shattering the silence, and paused,
Joao: as if trying to fit the correct words into a speach puzzle in his tongue.
Joao: From across the table <b>Joe</b> found himself in a slightly nervous antecipation.
Joao: After a few seconds of thought, <b>Bruce</b> finally said it.
Joao: "You need to do something for me".

Maria: "Hmm... sure, sure. What is it?" <b>Joe</b> asked, on the edge of reluctance.
Joao: <b>Bruce</b> went again into silent thought.
Joao: His posture was now almost as if cold and distant.
Joao: "I need you to meet me in the alley behind the drug store in Cleveland Street, today."
Joao: "10:00 PM, sharp",
Joao: this last word he accompanied with an audible finger tap on the table.
Maria: Despite being mildly confused, <b>Joe</b> nodded affirmatively.
Maria: "O-Okay... I'll be sure to be there."
Joao: "Good."
Joao: "Be there."
Joao: "Oh, and there comes Darius," 
Joao: and a radiant smile returned to <b>Bruce</b>'s face.

Joao: In the middle of the purpleish gloom of the alley,
Joao: <b>Joe</b> stood examining the graffiti scribbled on the dirty walls.
Joao: That hot summer day was finally relinquishing its place to the night.
Maria: He was waiting for <b>Bruce</b> to arrive,
Maria: but he had no idea WHY he was even waiting in the first place. 
Joao: The reasons for this meeting were completely unknown to him.
Maria: <b>Joe</b> only knew that, for the past few weeks,
Maria: <b>Bruce</b> had been acting in a rather odd manner.
Joao: And this,
Joao: this meetup in a dirty, stinking alley, with the ever fading sunlight
Joao: was the cherry on top of that uncanny cake.
Joao: Tired as he was, he felt like he could just fall asleep there and then.
Joao: If he was in his room, he would probably be in bed, already.
Joao: And he still had to call Josie about their plans for the following day.

Joao: <b>Joe</b> was facing the dead-end of the alley when, all of a sudden,
Joao: he heard the sound of heavy footsteps rushing towards him. 
Joao: As soon as he turned around to see who it was,
Joao: a bludgeoning blow sent him spinning awkwardly into the ground,
Joao: such was the force thrown into it. 
Maria: For just a second, he completely lost all logical awareness of space and time.
<<wait 5>>
Maria: Then, through the corner of his eye, he saw <b>Bruce</b> hovering above him,
Maria: his fists clenched into an almost perceivable tightness,
Maria: and a face as if chizzled out of irate stone.
Maria: <b>Joe</b> didn't know why and didn't know how,
Maria: but he understood immediately the scenario he was in.

Joao: <b>Bruce</b>'s didn't utter a single word.
Joao: He bent over and, with his large grip,
Joao: raised <b>Joe</b> up by his hair,
Joao: the bitter breath of cigarretes burning the inside of his nostrils.
Maria: Then, as if by some animalistic instinct of self-defense,
Maria: <b>Joe</b> found himself picking up a brick off the floor, and...
Joao: *THUD*
Maria: <b>Bruce</b> fell heavily on his back,
Maria: with blood seeping out of the newly made crevice on the side of his head,
Maria: and tears welling up in his newly offset eyes, 
Maria: while a burst of strong spasms toke hold of his entire body.
Maria: Down on his knees, with a brick in a tight grip,
Maria: <b>Joe</b> remained completely immobile,
Maria: his eyes, unblinking, completely fixed on <b>Bruce</b>'s.
Joao: A few moments later, the twitching stopped. 
Joao: Everything went static...
Joao: except the red stream of blood.

Joao: There was a heavy and cold darkness seeping out of the starless night's air,
Joao: only occasionally broken up by the dimly lit street lamps overhead.
Maria: With gloved hands tucked deep in his coat's pockets and his hood up, 
Maria: <b>Joe</b> slowly paced through the deserted streets of the city's suburbs, 
Maria: clothes bloodied and alone.
Maria: The blood however, wasn't his. 
Joao: A couple of hours before, and for the first time in his life, <b>Joe</b> murdered someone. 
Joao: If, at the present moment, you happened to ask him whom he killed, or how, 
Joao: he couldn't even begin to tell you. 
Joao: Most likely, he wouldn't even hear your voice.
Maria: From the moment it happened, his mind became a blank mass of numb dullness,
Maria: irregularly broken up by crimson rushes of flashing images,
Joao: He only knew he wanted to go home and bury himself in his bed,
Joao: and was blindly trusting his feet and legs to take him there by themselves.

Joao: As he entered the small appartment, he felt it was even more claustrophobic than usual.
Joao: Keeping the lights off and the window's blinds semi-opened,
Joao: <b>Joe</b> mindlessly hung the scarleted coat from the hanger on the back of the door,
Joao: the blood already dry.
Joao: He let himself fall backwards into the unmade bed, shoes still on.
Maria: As he was laying there, facing the partial gloom of the low, smudged ceiling,
Maria: he let his eyes go shut.
Maria: Sleep took over him.

Maria: All around him was a moving darkness, just out of reach.
Maria: Almost as if teasing him to come for it.
Maria: And, meanwhile, a distant ringing sound reached his ears.
Maria: He thought it was familiar, somehow.
Maria: It was becoming louder and louder and louder and louder...
Maria: He woke up. His phone was ringing.
Maria: <b>Josie</b> was the caller.
Maria: From head to toe, <b>Joe</b> suddenly grew heavily dull with the same numbness as before.
Maria: She was simultaneously the only and the last person he wanted to talk to right then.
Joao: He felt as if he was standing in the middle of a wire,
Joao: both ends of which were quickly burning away. 
Joao His head working a mile a minute when the ringing suddenly stopped.
Joao: <b>Joe</b> drew the heaviest of breaths. He felt like he was about to throw up.
Joao: All tension started seeping out from him. 
Maria: Then, like a razorwire through the air, through his mind, the phone suddenly rang again...
Maria: And, as if by some will of its own, his thumb accepted the call.

Joao: It was a cloudy Saturday morning. <b>Joe's</b> phone clock marked 10:12 AM.
Joao: Since he woke up before 8 (a nightmare of the <i>event</i> startled him awake),
Joao: he actually managed to arrive at Mandy's before 10,
Joao: but couldn't find it in him to enter. 
Maria: He was hidden in the adjacent alley to the coffee shop,
Maria: his mind working like spinning turbine.
Maria: <b>Josie</b>, more than likely, would already be inside, eagerly waiting for him.
Joao: <i>You got to enter... N-no-Yeah. You y-you just do... You got to.</i>
Joao: <i>If there's anyone in the whole world you can trust on, it's her.</i>
Joao: <b>Joe</b> took 5 deep breaths, slapped himself once, twice, three times in the face,
Joao: and, finally, after another deep breath, walked into the coffee shop.
Maria: From the back rightside of the place, neer a wide window,
Maria: a cheerful "Joey!" came to his ears.

Maria: "Hello, sleepyhead," she said in her usual <i>Good Morning, Sunshine!</i> mood.
Joao: "H-hey, Josie," he half-said, half-mumbled <b>Joe</b>, and then gave her a quick kiss. 
Joao: His lips were practically sandpaper, but she didn't seem to mind.
Maria: <b>Josie</b> still hadn't ordered anything. 
Maria: He couldn't help but feel guilty for making her wait for him, her stomach probably empty.
Maria: "Yesterday you sounded pretty tired..." she said,
Maria: not managing to hide a slightly worried tone.
Maria: "I'm sorry, I probably shouldn't have called at that hour..."
Joao: "N-n-no, d-don't worry about it." <b>Joe</b> tried his best to sound reassuring.
Joao: "I was... and still am, p-pretty tired..."
Joao: "You managed to cheer me up, though," this he managed to say without stuttering.
Maria: "Well," she said at the same time she patted his hand,
Maria: "I think a good 'Pick-me up' breakfast could really do you wonders," and smiled.
Maria: "How about we order something?"
Joao: <b>Josie</b> asked for a full-on english breakfast, along with a cappuccino.
Joao: <b>Joe</b> went with some buttered toast and plain black coffee. 
Joao: He did it more to fill the corresponding space in the table, than to fill his own gut.
Joao: He felt it rumbling like an unhinged earthquake, 
Joao: but also knew that, if any food came in, 
Joao: it could just as easily come out in the following minute.
Joao: The coffee, however, managed to sooth him - and his stomach - down a bit.

Maria: "I was thinking that after this, we could go to park a bit,"
Maria: <b>Josie</b> said with an inviting tone.
Maria: "Go see the lake. I hear there was a recent waddle of ducklings, there."
Joe: "Uh... sure. Sure," Joe mumbled, along with a too robotic nod of the head.
Maria: "And we could go to the movies this afternoon. Watch that new Tarantino flick."
Joe: "Hmm hmm," again mechanically nodding.
Maria: <b>Josie</b> could practically feel <b>Joe</b>'s tension from across the table.
Maria: His mumbling speach, the slight tremor on the table caused by the shaking of his right leg,
Maria: his fixation on the empty plate in front of him, as if it was blackhole for the eyesight.
Maria: Something was off. And she knew it.

Maria: "So, tell me, how did it go yesterday?", her smile urging him to cheer up a little.
Joao: "Uhh... 'it'? 'It', what? What d-do you mean?"
Maria: "The Software Enginnering exam, silly. Was it as hard as you thought it would be?"
Joao: "O-oh... That! That o-one... Yeah... it-it went okay, I guess.", he managed to say,
Joao: and raised his half-empty cup to his lips, but didn't remember to take a sip.
Joao: "Mrs. King was probably in a forgiving mood when she wrote it."
Maria: "That's so great, baby! I mean, with the ridiculous amount of study hours you poured into it,"
Maria: "I'm absolutely sure you killed it!"
Joao: The cup slipped from his fingers and fell with a dry *THUD* on the table,
Joao: spilling coffee all over its surface and his jeans.
Joao: <b>Joe</b> turned the color of curdled milk.
