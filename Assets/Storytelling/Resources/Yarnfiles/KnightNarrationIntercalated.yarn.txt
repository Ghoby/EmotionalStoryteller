Joao: This would be her first solitary venture into the wilds.
Maria: Ganji, her master, insisted that she should do this by herself.
Joao: "You're much too experienced to have this bag of old meat protecting you,"
Maria: was the last thing he said to her before she departed,
Joao: and before that he gifted her with his sword Sear,
Maria: named for the simmering heat its blade generated when swung or thrusted.
Joao: And tomorrow, Kali would hopefully put it to good use.
Maria: She had been following Its trail for more than a day now.
Joao: Sooner or later, it would end.
Maria: When she was done with the blade, she carefully placed it in its sheath,
Joao: and layed on her makeshift matress of leaves and moss, using her pack as a pillow.
Maria: "Tomorrow..." she remembered saying to herself as she fell asleep,
Joao: "tomorrow, you're dead."

Maria: Besides a tall pine tree, a mutilated human carcass lay in wait for her.
Joao: The axe of the man still carved into the thick trunk,
Maria: his hand, torn at the forearm, still holding on for the dear life of its dead owner.
Joao: Getting on her knees besides the bloody scene, Kali inspected the man's injuries.
Maria: Bruises, exposed fractures, lacerations, cuts and claw stabs, 
Joao: entrails spread through a 2 meter radius. 
Maria: From the body, a light blood trail slithered and vanished into the opposing greenery.
Joao: "This happened just a couple of hours ago", Kali thought out loud.
Maria: The whole thing was an image that even Ol'Glenn The Butcher would wince at.
Joao: But the strangest, most confounding thing of all,
Maria: was that It hadn't left a single bite mark on the woodsman, whatsoever;
Joao: It hadn't had a single intention of feeding on the man.
Maria: This Thing simply killed him for sport.
Joao: Or maybe...
Maria: A feeling had began growing on the back of Kali's consciousness during the past days.
Joao: A feeling that, during the quietest moments of her quest,
Maria: froze the insides with dread. 
Joao: And after seeing Its gruesome work at close hand... 
Maria: She thought... No! She KNEW this had to be bait. Bait for her.
Joao: It was waiting for her.
Maria: It was the hunter.
Joao: She was the prey.

Maria: The blood trail led to an enormous cave.
Joao: It's entrance, a wide-open mouth of dark gloom ripping out of the body of the hill's wall, 
Maria: broken and sharp stalactite and stalagmite fangs in wait of any entering prey. 
Joao: Grabbing a broken oak branch from the surrounding treeline, she took a bundle of dead leaves,
Maria: wrapped them around one of the branch's ends with some linen cloth soaked in old licor and,
Joao: after unbuckling Sear from its sheath, she waved it for a few seconds in the air
Maria: and pressed the scalding blade on the wet cloth. It caught fire instantly.
Maria: Now, the moment she feared, the moment she eagerly waited for, was at hand.
Joao: Up-and-down shivers needled the skin of her back and neck.
Maria: Sweat filled the inside of her trembling leather gloves.
Joao: Taking three deep breaths and a short prayer, she stepped into the darkness.

Maria: The torch's light was enough for her to get her imediate bearings,
Joao: but it also blinded Kali's eyes to the void outside the ring of light, 
Maria: which, at times, seemed almost alive with thought and tentacle motion.
Joao: Some years before, with Genji still carefully watching over her,
Maria: they hunted a highly vicious nightcrawler that hid himself in a cave not unlike this one.
Joao: They knew what it was capable of, having seen some of the gore it left on its bloody wake.
Maria: But they caught it. And they killed it. The dark couldn't protect him from Sear.
Joao: In the village, they were received with tremendous celebration and rejoice.
Maria: They even brought out some of the leftover fireworks from New Year's Celebration,
Joao: and fired them up into the stars. 
Maria: That was one of the happiest nights of Kali's life.
Joao: Kali smilled at the thought,
Maria: and the looming darkness felt like it had lost some of its initial weight.
Joao: She walked on, blood trail still underneath her heels.

Maria: She came to a point where the cave became slightly wider, and the ceiling much taller, 
Joao: so much so, that the light of her torch couldn't even reach it.
Maria: As her chest tightned, she drew Sear.
Joao: Any sign of shifting movement, any slight noise at the edge of earing, 
Maria: any wiff of decayed flesh, any pair of eyes glowing in the midst of the gloom,
Joao: her senses and muscles were ready to receive and respond, accordingly.
Maria: The trail ended abruptly. 
Joao: As if in one moment the blood was steadily falling to the ground,
Maria: and in another it had suddenly stopped.
Joao: A deep, guttural snarl, almost mocking in tone, came from behind her.
Maria: And when she turned around, she saw Its two slitted yellow eyes,
Joao: both screaming silently for her blood and flesh.
Maria: She wasn't surprised.
Joao: The Thing wasn't a nightcrawler.

Maria: She ran towards the Creature, swinging Sear ahead of her into an orange blaze,
Joao: and thrusted the blade into It, but the Thing swiftly dodged her attack,
Maria: and, with Its huge, bloated left arm, pounded her to the ground.
Joao: Kali, all air suddenly rushing out of her chest, felt like she was hit by a battering ram.
Maria: As she regained her breath, she couldn't help but smell It. 
Joao: A nausious reek, a mix of rotten flesh, bile and sulfur.
Maria: Sear still in hand, she picked up the dropped torch, its light weaker than before.
Joao: But it was enough for Kali to catch a glimpse of Its crimson filled, hairy snout, 
Maria: rows of brownish, sharp teeth adorning a hungry, devilish grin.
Joao: It jumped on her, swinging its arms and legs - dagger like claws in each - left and right, 
Maria: with Kali managing to dodge most of the incoming charge, but each time her blood was shed,
Joao: the horror, the fear inside her mind, spread further through her limbs.
Maria: And it was if the Thing felt revitelized, coming at her twice as much ferocity.
Joao: Kali couldn't say if this rush of attacks had lasted 2 minutes or 2 hours.
Maria: When It stopped, Kali had the the entirety of her coat and trousers ripped and bloodied.
Joao: Her left shoulder was dislocated, so she couldn't move the arm dangling underneath it.
Maria: Sear was still in her right hand, though. The torch she held in her teeth.
Joao: But she knew her body couldn't take much more of this.
Joao: "Last chance," she thought to herself.
Maria: And with all of her strength and will pulling for her body, she charged at It.

Joao: It responding in tandem, charging at her in a galloping motion.
Maria: She was violently knocked to ground.
Joao: Her right arm completely broken, Sear thrown into the darkness of the cave.
Maria: The Thing loomed over her, sadistic grin cut into Its monstrous maw.
Joao: Then, holding her down with one vicious paw, and in a single, savage motion,
Maria: It ripped out the entirety of her throat.
Joao: As life flowed out of her body through her veins,
Maria: a last, vapid sigh emanated from Kali's red lips.

Joao: The sky, completely stripped of clouds, flourished with glistening stars.
Maria: Every conceiveable constellation was there for the eye to see.
Joao: The Old Drake; Glundun's Lyre; the Fire Bull;
Maria: Kali watched them all from her little improvised camp,
Joao: right beneath a clearing in the low treetops of Salazar's Woods.
Maria: Her mind was a flury of images, most of them red with her blood.
Joao: Sear was lost to It.
Maria: And in her chest, her heart, she felt like there was something missing there.
Joao: There was a... hollowness somewhere inside,
Maria: where before was something deeply important to her.
Joao: But she couldn't remember what it was.
Maria: "Snap out of it, Kali," she reprimended herself in anger.
Joao: Ganji had warned her many hunters were mentally broken by their first death.
Maria: She could very well attest to that, now.
Joao: Trying to clear her head, she proceded with the sharpening of her own blade,
Maria: Moonlight.

Joao: She couldn't let it go, however.
Maria: Every scrape and tear It made on her body,
Joao: her dangling arm and dislodged shoulder,
Maria: Its warm, stinking breath on her neck, right before ripping it open...
Joao: These phantom memories filled her eyes, ears and mind.
Maria: She did her best to push them away, but she couldn't.
Joao: Her sleep that night was filled with visions.
Maria: That goulish, mocking smile was forever engraved on the inside of her eyelids.

Joao: Once more, she reached the cave's threshold. 
Maria: Hesitation rushed over her, yet she still walked in, very slowly.
Joao: Her grip holding Moon as tightly as it could.
Maria: She whispered a few words to the blade and it suddenly shone with silver light.
Joao: Holding it upwards, she went to meet her doom.

Maria: The sky, completely stripped of clouds, flourished with glistening stars.
Joao: Every conceiveable constellation was there for the eye to see.
Maria: But Kali didn't care. 
Joao: Before her eyes, only those eyes and mocking grin seemed to loom.
Maria: With each passing thought, it was if she escavated more and more into her soul.
Joao: The void, the hollow, it was spreading. 
Maria: Soon she wouldn't feel anymore.
Joao: But she still did. And fear was what she felt.
Maria: That night, she didn't sleep.

Joao: Again, she reached the cave and her nerves were in disarray.
Maria: Every cell of her body was trembling uncontrollably, screaming for her to run.
Joao: That it was useless. That she was weak. That if she continued,
Maria: she would end up becoming something completely abscent of soul, 
Joao: with a void in place of a beating heart.
Maria: But she had to kill it. That was the only path ahead of her.
Joao: Otherwise, what was the point of this whole endeavour?
Maria: Was there even a point to begin with?
Joao: "..."
Maria: "There is. There has to be."
Joao: She set her legs in motion, and stepped into the dark.
Maria: Fear, her one true companion.

Joao: This time, she didn't reach the end of the trail.
Maria: Her walking was slower this time, and she was practically dragging her feet when,
Joao: From above her, It dropped its entire weight and crushed her chest first onto the floor.
Maria: And It turned her around, Its entire body looming over her.
Joao: But then, just in the edge of the light of Moon, she saw its underbelly.
Maria: Extremely soft and pulsating, ever so slightly.
Joao: This vision filled her up, 
Maria: and she was dead before she realized.

Joao: In her makeshift camp, she was sitting on her bed made of dead leaves.
Maria: "Can I do it?"
Joao: "Am I fast enough?"
Maria: "No..."
Joao: "The question here is:"
Maria: "Am I terrified enough?"
Joao: "That's what will win me the fight."
Maria: "Only through the midst of fear can you find courage and victory,"

Maria: She managed to sleep that night and,
Joao: for the first time ever in her life, she was happy for the nightmares.

Maria: She came to the point where the cave became slightly wider and the ceiling much taller.
Joao: And she knew exactly she had to do.
Maria: Her feet took her to the the end of the trail.
Joao: Behind her, the Thing was already waiting for her in the dark, smelling the stink of her fear.
Maria: She paused. And counted to three.
Joao: One.
Maria: Two.
Joao: Three. 
Maria: And turning around, blade arm held back, she rushed towards It.
Joao: One last time.

Maria: At that moment, Its feral eyes betrayed something they never had before:
Joao: Surprise.
Maria: She slid underneath it and, when the thing's underbelly was right above her,
Joao: she thrust Moon upwards, with all the piercing force her arm could muster.
Maria: Crawling out through the side, she pulled her sword out and a plethora of green pus 
Joao: and viscera came tumbling out. 
Maria: The painfilled scream that poured out of the thing's mouth as it was dying was deafening.
Joao: She watched it until it its body grew lifeless.
Maria: It then slowly evaporated into black dust.
Joao: And, right in the middle of it, there was that which Kali had lost.

Maria: When she picked it up, the hollowness inside her chest was filled.
Joao: A sense of peace flooded her entire being. And she could return home.
Maria: Yet, she still felt different. You don't die and remain the same as you were before.
Joao: No one does. 
Maria: But still, she couldn't wait to tell Ganji about everything that happened.
Joao: She had died, and died, and died.
Maria: But she managed to recover from it.
Joao: She became The Hunter, and it the hunted.
Maria: And it was cause for celebration.
