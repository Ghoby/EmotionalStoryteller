Joao: The sky, completely stripped of clouds, flourished with glistening stars.
Joao: Every conceiveable constellation was there for the eye to see.
Joao: The S shape of the Old Drake;
Joao: The broken arch of Glundun's Lyre;
Joao: The confused, mishmash pattern of dots that made the Fire Bull;
Maria: Kali watched them all from her little improvised camp,
Maria: right beneath a clearing in the low treetops of Salazar's Woods.
Maria: She found herself happily grinning upwards,
Maria: remembering her last days on the village, before coming here.
Maria: Then, with a stronger arm than before,
Maria: she proceded with the sharpening of the blade.

Joao: This would be her first solitary venture into the wilds.
Joao: Ganji, her master, insisted that she should do this by herself.
Maria: "You're much too experienced to have this bag of old meat protecting you,"
Maria: was the last thing he said to her before she departed,
Maria: and before that he gifted her with his sword Sear,
Maria: named for the simmering heat its blade generated when swung or thrusted.
Joao: And tomorrow, Kali would hopefully put it to good use.
Joao: She had been following Its trail for more than a day now.
Joao: Sooner or later, it would end.
Maria: When she was done with the blade, she carefully placed it in its sheath,
Maria: and layed on her makeshift matress of leaves and moss, using her pack as a pillow.
Maria: "Tomorrow..." she remembered saying to herself as she fell asleep,
Maria: "tomorrow, you're dead."

Maria: The blood trail led to an enormous cave.
Maria: It's entrance, a wide-open mouth of dark gloom ripping out of the body of the hill's wall, 
Maria: broken and sharp stalactite and stalagmite fangs in wait of any entering prey. 
Joao: Grabbing a broken oak branch from the surrounding treeline, she took a bundle of dead leaves,
Joao: wrapped them around one of the branch's ends with some linen cloth soaked in old licor and,
Joao: after unbuckling Sear from its sheath, she waved it for a few seconds in the air
Joao: and pressed the scalding blade on the wet cloth. It caught fire instantly.
Maria: Now, the moment she feared, the moment she eagerly waited for, was at hand.
Maria: Up-and-down shivers needled the skin of her back and neck.
Maria: Sweat filled the inside of her trembling leather gloves.
Maria: Taking three deep breaths and a short prayer, she stepped into the darkness.

Maria: The torch's light was enough for her to get her immediate bearings,
Maria: but it also blinded Kali's eyes to the void outside the ring of light, 
Maria: which, at times, seemed almost alive with thought and tentacle motion.
Joao: Some years before, with Genji still carefully watching over her,
Joao: they hunted a highly vicious nightcrawler that hid himself in a cave not unlike this one.
Joao: They knew what it was capable of, having seen some of the gore it left on its bloody wake.
Joao: But they caught it. And they killed it. The dark couldn't protect him from Sear.
Joao: In the village, they were received with tremendous celebration and rejoice.
Joao: They even brought out some of the leftover fireworks from New Year's Celebration,
Joao: and fired them up into the stars. 
Joao: That was one of the happiest nights of Kali's life.
Maria: Kali smilled at the thought,
Maria: and the looming darkness felt like it had lost some of its initial weight.
Maria: She walked on, blood trail still underneath her heels.

Maria: She came to a point where the cave became slightly wider, and the ceiling much taller, 
Maria: so much so, that the light of her torch couldn't even reach it.
Joao: As her chest tightned, she drew Sear.
Joao: Any sign of shifting movement, any slight noise at the edge of earing, 
Joao: any wiff of decayed flesh, any pair of eyes glowing in the midst of the gloom,
Joao: her senses and muscles were ready to receive and respond, accordingly.
Maria: The trail ended abruptly. 
Maria: As if in one moment the blood was steadily falling to the ground,
Maria: and in another it had suddenly stopped.
Maria: A deep, guttural snarl, almost mocking in tone, came from behind her.
Maria: And when she turned around, she saw Its two slitted yellow eyes,
Maria: both screaming silently for her blood and flesh.
Joao: She wasn't surprised.
Joao: The Thing wasn't a nightcrawler.

Joao: She ran towards the Creature, swinging Sear ahead of her into an orange blaze,
Joao: and thrusted the blade into It, but the Thing swiftly dodged her attack,
Joao: and, with Its huge, bloated left arm, pounded her to the ground.
Joao: Kali, all air suddenly rushing out of her chest, felt like she was hit by a battering ram.
Maria: As she regained her breath, she couldn't help but smell It. 
Maria: A nausious reek, a mix of rotten flesh, bile and sulfur.
Maria: Sear still in hand, she picked up the dropped torch, its light weaker than before.
Maria: But it was enough for Kali to catch a glimpse of Its crimson filled, hairy snout, 
Maria: rows of brownish, sharp teeth adorning a hungry, devilish grin.
Joao: It jumped on her, swinging its arms and legs - dagger like claws in each - left and right, 
Joao: with Kali managing to dodge most of the incoming charge, but each time her blood was shed,
Joao: the horror, the fear inside her mind, spread further through her limbs.
Joao: And it was if the Thing felt revitelized, coming at her twice as much ferocity.
Maria: Kali couldn't say if this rush of attacks had lasted 2 minutes or 2 hours.
Maria: When It stopped, Kali had the the entirety of her coat and trousers ripped and bloodied.
Maria: Her left shoulder was dislocated, so she couldn't move the arm dangling underneath it.
Maria: Sear was still in her right hand, though. The torch she held in her teeth.
Maria: But she knew her body couldn't take much more of this.
Joao: "Last chance," she thought to herself.
Joao: And with all of her strength and will pulling for her body, she charged at It.

Joao: The Old Drake; Glundun's Lyre; the Fire Bull;
Maria: Kali watched them all from her little improvised camp,
Maria: right beneath a clearing in the low treetops of Salazar's Woods.
Maria: Her mind was a flury of images, most of them red with her blood.
Maria: Sear was lost to It.
Maria: And in her chest, her heart, she felt like there was something missing there.
Maria: There was a... hollowness somewhere inside,
Maria: where before was something deeply important to her.
Maria: But she couldn't remember what it was.
Maria: "Snap out of it, Kali," she reprimended herself in anger.
Joao: Ganji had warned her many hunters were mentally broken by their first death.
Joao: Having died, she could very well attest to that, now.
Maria: Trying to clear her head, she proceded with the sharpening of her own blade,
Maria: Moonlight.

Joao: Once more, she reached the cave's threshold. 
Joao: Hesitation rushed over her, yet she still walked in, very slowly.
Maria: Her grip holding Moon as tightly as it could.
Maria: She whispered a few words to the blade and it suddenly shone with silver light.
Maria: Holding it upwards, she went to meet her doom.

Joao: This time, she didn't reach the end of the trail.
Joao: Her walking was slower this time, and she was practically dragging her feet when,
Joao: From above her, It dropped its entire weight and crushed her chest first onto the floor.
Joao: And It turned her around, Its entire body looming over her.
Joao: But then, just in the edge of the light of Moon, she saw its underbelly.
Joao: Extremely soft and pulsating, ever so slightly.
Maria: This vision filled her up, 
Maria: and she was dead before she realized.

Maria: She came to the point where the cave became slightly wider and the ceiling much taller.
Joao: And she knew exactly she had to do.
Maria: Her feet took her to the the end of the trail.
Joao: Behind her, the Thing was already waiting for her in the dark, smelling the stink of her fear.
Maria: She paused. And counted to three.
Maria: One.
Maria: Two.
Maria: Three. 
Maria: And turning around, blade arm held back, she rushed towards It.
Maria: One last time.

Maria: At that moment, Its feral eyes betrayed something they never had before:
Maria: Surprise.
Maria: She slid underneath it and, when the thing's underbelly was right above her,
Maria: she thrust Moon upwards, with all the piercing force her arm could muster.
Joao: Crawling out through the side, she pulled her sword out and a plethora of green pus 
Joao: and viscera came tumbling out. 
Joao: The painfilled scream that poured out of the thing's mouth as it was dying was deafening.
Joao: She watched it until it its body grew lifeless.
Joao: It then slowly evaporated into black dust.
Maria: And, right in the middle of it, there was that which Kali had lost.

Maria: When she picked it up, the hollowness inside her chest was filled.
Maria: A sense of peace flooded her entire being. And she could return home.
Maria: Yet, she still felt different. You don't die and remain the same as you were before.
Joao: No one does. 
Joao: But still, she couldn't wait to tell Ganji about everything that happened.
Joao: She had died, and died, and died.
Maria: But she managed to recover from it.
Maria: She became The Hunter, and it the hunted.
Joao: And it was cause for celebration.
