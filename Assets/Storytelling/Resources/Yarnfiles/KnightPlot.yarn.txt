Joao: The sky, completely stripped of clouds, flourished with glistening stars.
Joao: Every conceiveable constellation was there for the eye to see.
Joao: The S shape of the Old Drake;
Joao: The broken arch of Glundun's Lyre;
Joao: The confused, mishmash pattern of dots that made the Fire Bull;
Maria: Kali watched them all from her little improvised camp,
Maria: right beneath a clearing in the low treetops of Salazar's Woods.
Maria: She found herself happily grinning upwards,
Maria: remembering her last days on the village, before coming here.
Maria: Then, with a stronger arm than before,
Maria: she proceded with the sharpening of her blade.

Joao: This would be her first solitary venture into the wilds.
Joao: Ganji, her master, insisted that she should do this by herself.
Maria: "You're much too experienced to have this bag of old meat protecting you,"
Maria: was the last thing he said to her before she departed,
Maria: and before that he gifted her with his sword Sear,
Maria: named for the simmering heat its blade generated when swung or thrusted.
Joao: And tomorrow, Kali would hopefully put it to good use.
Joao: She had been following Its trail for more than a day now.
Joao: Sooner or later, it would end.
Maria: When she was done with the blade, she carefully placed it in its sheath,
Maria: and layed on her makeshift matress of leaves and moss, using her pack as a pillow.
Maria: "Tomorrow..." she remembered saying to herself as she fell asleep,
Maria: "tomorrow, you're dead."

Joao: A layer of ashen clouds, like a grey thief,
Joao: infiltrated themselves in the overhead blue sky and refused to leave.
Joao: In this part of the woods, this meant visibility was heavily constrained to human eyes.
Maria: Kali walked with the silence of a phantom through the trunks and bushes,
Maria: her trained olfact and earing ready to receive the slightest of stimuli,
Maria: right hand gripping the hilt of Sear, almost tenderly.
Maria: Then, a metalic odor, almost too faint for detection, tickled her nose.
Maria: She followed it slowly, in growing antecipation of its source.

Joao: Besides a tall pine tree, a mutilated human carcass lay in wait for her.
Joao: The axe of the man still carved into the thick trunk,
Joao: his hand, torn at the forearm, still holding on for the dear life of its dead owner.
Maria: Getting on her knees besides the bloody scene, Kali inspected the man's injuries.
Maria: Bruises, exposed fractures, lacerations, cuts and claw stabs, 
Maria: entrails spread through a 2 meter radius. 
Maria: From the body, a light blood trail slithered and vanished into the opposing greenery.
Maria: "This happened just a couple of hours ago", Kali thought out loud.
Maria: The whole thing was an image that even Ol'Glenn The Butcher would wince at.
Joao: But the strangest, most confounding thing of all,
Joao: was that It hadn't left a single bite mark on the woodsman, whatsoever;
Joao: It hadn't had a single intention of feeding on the man.
Joao: This Thing simply killed him for sport.
Joao: Or maybe...
Joao: A feeling had began growing on the back of Kali's consciousness during the past days.
Joao: A feeling that, during the quietest moments of her quest,
Joao: froze the inside of her chest with dread. 
Joao: And after seeing Its gruesome work at close hand... 
Joao: She knew. She KNEW this had to be bait. Bait for her.
Maria: It was waiting for her.
Joao: It was the hunter.
Maria: She was the prey.

Maria: The blood trail led to an enormous cave.
Maria: It's entrance, a wide-open mouth of dark gloom ripping out of the body of the hill's wall, 
Maria: broken and sharp stalactite and stalagmite fangs in wait of any entering prey. 
Joao: Grabbing a broken oak branch from the surrounding treeline, she took a bundle of dead leaves,
Joao: wrapped them around one of the branch's ends with some linen cloth soaked in old licor and,
Joao: after unbuckling Sear from its sheath, she waved it for a few seconds in the air,
Joao: and pressed the scalding blade on the wet cloth. It fire caught on instantly.
Maria: Now, the moment she feared, the moment she eagerly waited for, was at hand.
Maria: Up-and-down shivers needled the skin of her back and neck.
Maria: Sweat filled the inside of her trembling leather gloves.
Maria: Taking three deep breaths and a short prayer, she stepped into the darkness.

Maria: The torch's light was enough for her to get her imediate bearings,
Maria: but it also blinded Kali's eyes to the void outside the ring of light, 
Maria: which, at times, seemed almost alive with thought and tentacle motion.
Joao: Some years before, with Genji still carefully watching over her,
Joao: they hunted an highly vicious nightcrawler that hid himself in a cave not unlike this one.
Joao: They knew what it was capable of, having seen some of the gore it left on its bloody wake.
Joao: But they caught it. And they killed it. The dark couldn't protect him from Sear.
Joao: In the village, they were received with tremendous celebration and rejoice.
Joao: They even brought out some of the leftover fireworks from New Year's Celebration,
Joao: and fired them up into the stars. 
Joao: That was one of the happiest nights of Kali's life.
Maria: Kali smilled at the thought,
Maria: and the looming darkness felt like it had lost some of its initial weight.
Maria: She walked on, blood trail still underneath her heels.

Maria: She came to a point where the cave became slightly wider, and the ceiling much taller, 
Maria: so much so, that the light of her torch couldn't even reach it.
Joao: As her chest tightned, she drew Sear.
Joao: Any sign of shifting movement, any slight noise at the edge of earing, 
Joao: any wiff of decayed flesh, any pair of eyes glowing in the midst of the gloom,
Joao: her senses and muscles were ready to receive and respond, accordingly.
Maria: The trail ended abruptly. 
Maria: As if in one moment, the blood was steadily falling to the ground,
Maria: and in another, it had suddenly stopped.
Maria: A deep, guttural snarl, almost mocking in tone, came from behind her.
Maria: She wasn't surprised. Actually, she felt relieved it had finally happened.
Maria: And when she turned around, she saw Its two slitted yellow eyes,
Maria: both screaming silently for her blood and flesh.

Joao: She ran towards him, swinging Sear ahead of her into an orange blaze.
Joao: She thrusted the blade into It, but the Thing swiftly dodged her attack,
Joao: and, with Its huge, bloated left arm, pounded her to the ground.
Joao: Kali, all air suddenly rushing out of her chest, felt like she was hit by a battering ram.
Maria: As she regained her breath, she couldn't help but smell It. 
Maria: A nausious reek, a mix of rotten flesh, bile and sulfur.
Maria: Sear still in hand, she picked up the dropped torch, its light weaker than before.
Maria: But it was enough for Kali to catch a glimpse of Its crimson filled, hairy snout, 
Maria: rows of brownish, sharp teeth adorning a hungry, devilish grin.
Joao: It jumped on her, swinging its arms and legs - dagger like claws in each - left and right, 
Joao: with Kali managing to dodge most of the incoming charge, but each time she her blood was shed,
Joao: it was if the Thing felt revitelized, coming at her then with twice the ferocity.
Maria: Kali couldn't say if this rush of attacks had lasted 2 minutes or 2 hours.
Maria: When It stopped, Kali had the the entirety of her ripped coat and sleaves bloodied.
Maria: Her left shoulder was dislocated, so she couldn't move the arm dangling underneath it.
Maria: Sear was still in her right hand, though. The torch she held in her teeth.
Maria: But she knew her body couldn't take much more of this.

Joao: "Last chance," she thought to herself.
Joao: And with all of her strength and will pulling for her body, she charged at It,
Joao: It responding in tandem, charging at her in a galloping motion.
Maria: She was violently knocked to ground.
Maria: Her right arm completely broken, Sear thrown into the darkness of the cave.
Maria: The Thing loomed over her, sadistic grin cut into Its monstrous maw.
Joao: Then, holding her down with one vicious paw, and in a single, savage motion,
Joao: It ripped out the entirety of her throat.
Joao: As life flowed out of her body through her veins,
Joao: a last, vapid sigh emanated from Kali's red lips.

Joao: The Old Drake; Glundun's Lyre; the Fire Bull;
Maria: Kali watched them all from her little improvised camp,
Maria: right beneath a clearing in the low treetops of Salazar's Woods.
Maria: Her mind was a flury of images, most of them red with blood.
Maria: Sear was lost to It.
Maria: In her chest, her heart, it felt like there was something missing there.
Maria: There was a... hollowness somewhere inside,
Maria: where before was something deeply important to her.
Maria: But she couldn't remember what it was.
Maria: "Snap out of it, Kali," she reprimended herself in anger.
Maria: Trying to clear her head, she proceded with the sharpening of her own blade,
Maria: Moonlight.

Joao: She couldn't let it go, however.
Joao: Every scrape and tear It made on her body,
Joao: her dangling arm and dislodged shoulder,
Joao: Its warm, stinking breath on her neck, right before ripping it open...
Joao: These phantom memories filled her eyes, ears and mind.
Joao: She did her best to forget about them, but she couldn't.
Maria: But there was one thing that stuck with her.
Maria: The soft flesh underneath Its chest. Its stomach and entrails, all unprotected.
Maria: "I just have to wait for the right moment. Don't rush it."
Maria: Her sleep that night was filled with visions.
Maria: That goulish, mocking smile was forever engraved on the inside of her eyelids.

Joao: Once more, she reached the cave's threshold. 
Joao: Hesitation rushed over her, yet she still walked in, very slowly.
Maria: Her grip holding Moon as tightly as it could.
Maria: She whispered a few words to the blade and it suddenly shone with silver light.
Maria: Holding it upwards, she went to meet her doom.

Joao: The same place of before, the spot where the blood ends.
Joao: Kali knows It is standing behind her, already eating her with those yellow eyes.
Joao: But it was as if her legs were frozen. Her arms too.
Joao: She screamed but no words come out of her mouth. 
Joao: Fear has taken over her body, holding it still for the slaughter.
Joao: She tries, and tries and tries to move her body, but it doesn't obey.
Joao: The heavy breathing behind her grows louder by the minute,
Joao: anytime now, its source will have reached her.
Joao: She tries, this time harder, and again, and again, and again, and...
Maria: She turns. 
Maria: It looms over her, the same mocking bloody grin carved in its muzzle,
Maria: the same eyes, all devouring, piercing her entire being.
Maria: And in a split second, her is head is ripped from her body by Its jaws.

Joao: Every conceiveable constellation was there for the eye to see.
Joao: But Kali didn't care. 
Joao: Before her eyes, only those eyes and mocking grin seemed to loom.
Maria: With each passing thought, it was if she escavated more and more into her soul.
Maria: The void, the hollow, it was spreading. 
Maria: Soon she wouldn't feel anymore.
Maria: But she still did. And fear was what she felt.
Maria: That night, she didn't sleep.

Joao: Again, she reached the cave and her nerves were in disarray.
Joao: Every cell of her body was trembling uncontrollably, screaming for her to run.
Joao: That it was useless. That she was weak. That if she continued,
Joao: she would end up becoming something completely abscent of soul, 
Joao: with a void in place of a beating heart.
Maria: But she had to kill it. That was the only path ahead of her.
Maria: Otherwise, what was the point of this whole endeavour?
Maria: Was there even a point to begin with?
Maria: "..."
Maria: "There is. There has to be."
Maria: She then set her legs in motion, and stepped into the dark.

Maria: She came to the point where the cave became slightly wider and the ceiling much taller.
Joao: She knew exactly where it would be now.
Joao: Her blade, Moon, gave the surrounding circular area a silverly glow.
Maria: She reached the end of the trail.
Maria: She paused. And counted to three.
Maria: One.
Maria: Two.
Maria: Three. And turning around, blade arm held back, she ran towards It.
Maria: She thought she saw Its feral eyes betraying something that they previously hadn't:
Maria: Surprise.
Maria: She slid underneath it and, when the Thing's underbelly was right above her,
Maria: she thrust Moon with all the force her arm could muster.
Joao: Crawling out through the side, she pulled her sword out and a plethora of green pus 
Joao: and viscera came tumbling out. 
Joao: The painfilled scream that poured out of the Thing's mouth as it was dying was deafening.
Joao: It fell, lifeless, on the stone floor, slowly evaporating into black dust.
Maria: And, right in the middle of it, there was that which Kali had lost.

Maria: When she picked it up, hollowness inside her chest was filled.
Maria: A sense of peace flooded her entire being. And she could return home.
Maria: Yet, she still felt different. You don't die and remain the same as you were before.
Joao: No one does. 
Joao: But still, she couldn't wait to tell Ganji about everything that happened.
Joao: Her first death had happened. It was cause for celebration.
