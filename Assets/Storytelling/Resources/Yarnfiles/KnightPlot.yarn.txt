Joao: The sky, completely stripped of clouds, flourished with glistening stars.
Joao: Every conceiveable constellation was there for the eye to see.
Joao: The S shape of the Old Drake;
Joao: The broken arch of Glundun's Lyre;
Joao: The confused pattern of glowing dots that made the Fire Bull;
Maria: Kali watched them all from her little improvised camp,
Maria: right beneath a clearing in the low treetops of Salazar's Woods.
Maria: She found herself happily grinning upwards,
Maria: remembering her last days on the village.
Maria: Then, with stronger determination than before,
Maria: she proceded with the sharpening of her blade.

Joao: This would be her first solitary hunt.
Joao: Ganji, her master, insisted that she should do this one by herself.
Maria: "You're much too experienced to have this bag of old meat protecting you,"
Maria: he said to her before her departure, and right before gifting her with his sword
Maria: Sear, named for the simmering heat generated by the blade when swung or thrusted.
Maria: But, when lying still or sheathed, it would remain cool as frost.
Joao: And tomorrow, Kali would hopefully put it to good use.
Joao: She had been following a trail of blood for more than a day now.
Joao: It had to end soon.
Maria: When she was done with the blade, she carefully placed it in its sheath,
Maria: and layed on her makeshift matress of leaves.
Maria: "Tomorrow, I'm going to get you," she remembered saying to her self,
Maria: as she fell into a dreamless sleep.
