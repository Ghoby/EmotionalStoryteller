Joao: It was friday afternoon,
Joao: and the Thirsty Dog Bar was bursting with an excited buzz of cursing and laughter.
Joao: After an intense week of evaluations and classes,
Joao: many students felt the need for a bit of drunken comradery.
Joao: The one who was screaming and shouting the loudest was <b>Bruce</b>.
Maria: <b>Joe</b> and <b>Darius</b> were almost baffled by it.
Maria: Despite being the tallest of the three, and having an impressive athletic physique,
Maria: he was surprisingly prone to turn awkwardly shy and silent in public.
Joao: The "almost" in "almost baffled" comes from the fact that, for the past few days,
Joao: <b>Bruce</b> was acting in a completely different manner to his usual self,
Joao: so the present situation was just another example of it.

Joao: "And th-and then, and then, the guy and his girl, just like..." 
Joao: "Got run over by an invisible car!",
Joao: "AN! INVISIBLE! CAAAAAAAAAR!!!", 
Joao: Bruce shouted with an inebriated fascination, almost choking with laughing.
Joao: "They j-just spun through the air like Half-Life 2 ragdolls!"
Maria: "That Instagram video's fake, bruh,", inteviened <b>Darius</b>, 
Maria: albeit with a bemuzement clearly present in his face and voice.
Joao: "But, I mean, let's be honest here! It's a pretty decent fake out," 
Joao: <b>Joe</b> couldn't help pointing out.
Maria: "Yeah, those two that got hit must be hired mimes, or something,"
Maria: "to fly through the air because of an invisible car pfffft..."
Maria: And the three of them burst out laughing simultaneously.
Joao: As the clamour died down,
Joao: <b>Joe</b> felt truly relieved that the week was finally over.
Joao: The two exams he had in past five days, were,
Joao: for a lack of a better term, an absolute pain to study for.
Joao: especially the one he did that very same day.
Joao: He could finally get some decent shuteye, even if only for a couple of days.
Joao: Plus, he could be with Josie. 
Joao: That what he was looking forward to the most.

Joao: There was a heavy and cold darkness seeping out of the starless night's air,
Joao: only occasionally broken up by the dimly lit street lamps overhead.
Maria: With gloved hands tucked deep in his winter coat's pockets and his hood up, 
Maria: <b>Joe</b> slowly paced through the deserted streets of the city's suburbs, 
Maria: clothes bloodied and alone.
Maria: The blood however, wasn't his. 
Joao: A couple of hours before, and for the first time in his life, <b>Joe</b> murdered someone. 
Joao: If, at the present moment, you happened to ask him whom he killed, or how, 
Joao: he couldn't even begin to tell you. 
Joao: Most likely, he wouldn't even hear your voice.
Maria: From the moment it happened, his mind became a blank mass of numb dullness,
Maria: irregularly broken up by crimson rushes of flashing images,
Joao: He only knew he wanted to go home and bury himself in his bed,
Joao: and was blindly trusting his feet and legs to take him there by themselves.

Maria: <b>Joe</b> found himself stopping beneath a streetlamp, 
Maria: whose light was peridocally on-and-offing.
Joao: A black cat was sitting right in front of him, poised almost like a living statue
Joao: right at the edge of the ray of light coming from above,
Joao: its slim and elegant figure appearing and disappearing in tandem with the flickering above.
Maria: He stood there,
Maria: the hairs in his arms and back all prickled up
Maria: gazing at the animal's greenish yellow eyes for what seemed like an eternity.
Maria: An almost relaxing warm and gentle breeze flowed right between them.

Maria: Finally, the cat broke the stillness of the moment and ran away into the darkness.
Joao: To his surprise, the dark clouds in his mind weren't there anymore, 
Joao: as if the breeze had blown them away into mental oblivion.
Joao: His head was indeed still pounding (and quite vividely),
Joao: but he could, at the very least, think with some sense of clarity.
Maria: He began walking with a bit more of conscious purpose.
Maria: A few twists and turns and, fifteen minutes after the episode with the cat,
Maria: he reached his appartment.

Joao: As he entered the small appartment, he felt it was even more claustrophobic than usual.
Joao: Keeping the lights off and the window's blinds semi-opened,
Joao: <b>Joe</b> mindlessly hung the bloodied coat from the hanger on the back of the door.
Joao: He threw himself into the unmade bed, shoes on and everything.
Maria: As he was laying there, facing the partial gloom of the low, smudged ceiling,
Maria: he shut his eyes.
Maria: Sleep took over him.

Maria: "Hey, do you guys want anything else from the bar?", asked <b>Darius</b>.
Joao: "Nah, I'll pass," <b>Joe</b> said, 
Joao: who was already three beers under and he didn't want to get anywhere beyond tipsy.
Joao: Bruce, however, asked for another beer. It would be his seventh.
Joao: "I'm thirsty today", he said, and his mouth twisted into a grin that,
Joao: even according with his "brand new" persona, stroke <b>Joe</b> as uncharacteristically odd.
Maria: For the first time since they came into the Thirsty Dog, their table,
Maria: and the whole bar for that matter, fell into a sort of unusual quiet.
<<wait 5>>
Joao: "Joe, uhm..." said <b>Bruce</b>, shattering the silence, and paused,
Joao: as if trying to fit the correct words into a speach puzzle in his tongue.
Joao: From across the table <b>Joe</b> found himself in a slightly nervous antecipation.
Joao: After a few seconds of thought, <b>Bruce</b> finally said what he wanted.
Joao: "You need to do something for me".

Joao: A couple of hours later, <b>Joe</b> woke up.
Maria: He felt an uncontrolable urge to eat something.
Joao: Grabbing a couple of eggs from the fridge and a pan from the cabinet opposite,
Joao: he began scrambling them on the stove. He also fried some bacon.
Joao: His movements were robotic and instictive, 
Joao: almost as if he was on some sort of auto-pilot. 
Maria: Then, after clearing a space between the mess of papers on his desk,
Maria: he settled a plate with the eggs and bacon on it and began gulping them down.
Maria: Not even a minute had passed, and it was already empty.
Joao: <b>Joe</b> felt like he could swallow the entire universe.
Joao: He got up to see what else he could eat, when his phone started to ring.

Maria: <b>Josie</b> was the caller.
Maria: From head to toe, <b>Joe</b> suddenly grew heavily numb.
Maria: She was simultaneously the only and the last person he wanted to talk to right then.
Joao: He felt as if he was standing in the middle of a wire,
Joao: both ends of which were quickly burning away. 
Joao His head working a mile a minute when the ringing suddenly stopped.
Joao: <b>Joe</b> drew the heaviest of breaths. He felt like he was about to throw up.
Joao: All tension started seeping out from him. 
Maria: Then, like a razorwire through the air, through his mind, the phone suddenly rang again...
Maria: And, as if by some will of its own, his thumb accepted the call.

Maria: "Hey baby! I'm so sorry I'm calling you at 1 AM. Hope I didn't wake you..."
Joao: <b>Joe</b>'s mouth was completely dry, as if his throat was filled with sand.
Joao: "*cough* H-hey! *cough* Uhh-uh n-no, no, I-I was a-awake, don't w-worry 'bout it."
Maria: "Well... you do sound a bit drousy," she said with a warm giggle.
Maria: "I know the day was probably tough on you."
Joao: "..."
Maria: "Well, I'll be quick then," she said in a reassuring tone.
Maria: "I was just wondering if you wanted to grab breakfast with me tomorrow morning."
Maria: "We haven't done it in a while."
Joao: "U-uh... y-yeah, sure..." he managed to mumble out,
Joao: and then, in a more decisive manner, "yeah, let's do it."
Maria: "...Great, great! Uhh... then, let's meet at Mandy's at... 10:30. Okay?"
Joao: "...Yeah, okay. Sound-sounds good..."
Maria: "Cool. Now, get yourself a good night's rest. Can't wait to be with you tomorrow!"
Maria: "Love you, Joey!"
Joao: "L-love you too... I r-really do..."
Maria: She hung up, but not without audibly smiling first.
Maria: <b>Joe</b>, phone still in his tightned grip, layed himself down on the bed.
Maria: And he closed his eyes.

Maria: "Hmm... sure, sure. What is it?" <b>Joe</b> asked, on the edge of reluctance.
Joao: <b>Bruce</b> went again into silent thought.
Joao: His posture was now almost as if cold and distant.
Joao: "I need you to meet me in the alley behind the drug store in Cleveland Street, today."
Joao: "8:00 PM, sharp",
Joao: this last word accompanied with an audible tap on the table by his right index finger.
Maria: Despite being mildly confusion, <b>Joe</b> nodded affirmatively.
Maria: "O-Okay... I'll be sure to be there."
Joao: "Good."
Joao: "Be there."
Joao: "Oh, and there comes Darius," 
Joao: and a radiant smile returned to <b>Bruce</b>'s face.

Joao: It was a cloudy Saturday morning. <b>Joe's</b> phone clock marked 10:12 AM.
Joao: Since he woke up before 8:00 (a nightmare of the <i>event</i> startled him awake),
Joao: he actually managed to arrive at Mandy's before 10:00,
Joao: but couldn't find it in him to enter. 
Maria: He was hidden in the adjacent alley to the coffee shop,
Maria: his mind working like spinning turbine.
Maria: <b>Josie</b>, more than likely, would already be inside, eagerly waiting for him.
Joao: <i>You got to enter... N-no-Yeah. You y-you just do... You got to.</i>
Joao: <i>If there's anyone in the whole world you can trust on, it's her.</i>
Joao: <b>Joe</b> took 5 deep breaths, slapped himself once, twice, three times in the face,
Joao: and, finally, after another deep breath, walked into the coffee shop.
Maria: From the back rightside of the place, neer a wide window,
Maria: a cheerful "Joey!" came to his ears.

Maria: "Hello, sleepyhead," she said in her usual <i>Good Morning, Sunshine!</i> mood.
Joao: "H-hey, Josie," he half-said, half-mumbled <b>Joe</b>, and then gave her a quick kiss. 
Joao: His lips were practically sandpaper, but she didn't seem to mind.
Maria: <b>Josie</b> still hadn't ordered anything. 
Maria: He couldn't help but feel guilty for making her wait for him, her stomach probably empty.
Maria: "Yesterday you sounded pretty tired..." she said,
Maria: not managing to hide a slightly worried tone.
Maria: "I'm sorry, I probably shouldn't have called at that hour..."
Joao: "N-n-no, d-don't worry about it." <b>Joe</b> tried his best to sound reassuring.
Joao: "I was... and still am, p-pretty tired..."
Joao: "You managed to cheer me up, though," this he managed to say without stuttering.
Maria: "Well," she said at the same time she patted his hand,
Maria: "I think a good 'Pick-me up' breakfast could really do you wonders," and smiled.
Maria: "How about we order something?"
Joao: <b>Josie</b> asked for a full-on english breakfast, along with a cappuccino.
Joao: <b>Joe</b> went with some buttered toast and plain black coffee. 
Joao: He did it more to fill the corresponding space in the table, than to fill his own gut.
Joao: He felt it rumbling like an unhinged earthquake, 
Joao: but also knew that, if any food came in, 
Joao: it could just very easily come out in the following minute.
Joao: The coffee, however, managed to sooth him, and his stomach, down a bit.

Maria: "So, tell me, how did it go yesterday?", her smile inviting him to cheer up a little.
Joao: "Uhh... 'it'? 'It', what? What d-do you mean?"
Maria: "The Creative Writing exam, silly. Was it as hard as you thought it would be?"
Joao: "O-oh... That! That o-one... Yeah... it-it went okay, I guess.", he managed to say,
Joao: and raised his half-empty cup to his lips, but didn't remember to take a sip.
Joao: "Mrs. King was probably in a forgiving mood when she wrote it."
Maria: "That's so great, baby! I mean, with the ridiculous amount of study hours you poured into it,"
Maria: "I'm absolutely sure you killed it!"
Joao: The cup slipped from his fingers and fell with a dry *THUD* on the table,
Joao: spilling coffee all over its surface and his jeans.

Joao: "I-I-I-I-I-I'm s-sorry!", 
Joao: was all <b>Joe</b>, now a completely nervous wreck, could find in himself to say.
Maria: "No no no no. Baby, don't apologize. It's okay! It happens," she reassured him,
Maria: while using both of their napkins to dry <b>Joe's</b> clothes and then the table.
Maria: "Baby, it's okay, really. It happens."
Joao: "No no no no no no no, I-I-I-I'm j-just-t, I'm just..."
Maria: "Joe, baby, look at me. Please, please look at me," she said with a surprising calmness,
Maria: and again, she put her hand over his, squeezing it tenderly.
Maria: "In these past couple of years, I've seen you tired. I've seen you exhausted."
Maria: "But this... This doesn't feel like any of that."
Joao: "B-b-but..."
Maria: "Please, baby, let's go to my place. Right now. I need you to tell me what is going on."
Joao: "B-b-b-bu-..."
Maria: "Joe, honey, please. Trust me. You can trust me, okay?"
Joao: "..."
Maria: "Then please, let's go to my place. I'll drive us there."
Joao: He managed to give a couple of slight nods.
Joao: <b>Josie</b> got up and payed both their tabs,
Joao: while also apologizing for leaving without getting the food first.
Joao: She then took him by the hand and walked him to her car.
Maria: Like a trained dog, he simply followed her, in dead silence.
Maria: Before starting the motor, she softly stroke the back of her hand on his cheek.
Maria: "It's all gonna be okay, Joey dear. Believe me."
Maria: And they drove off.
