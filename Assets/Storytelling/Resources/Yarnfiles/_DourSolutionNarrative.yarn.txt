Maria: The blood trail she was following led to an enormous cave.
Maria: It's entrance, a wide-open mouth of dark gloom ripping out of the body of the hill's wall, 
Maria: broken and sharp stalactite and stalagmite fangs in wait of any entering prey.

Maria: Grabbing a broken oak branch from the surrounding treeline, she took a bundle of dead leaves,
Maria: wrapped them around one of the branch's ends with some linen cloth soaked in old licor and,
Maria: after unbuckling Sear, her blade, from its sheath, she waved it for a few seconds in the air
Maria: and pressed the scalding blade on the wet cloth. It caught fire instantly.
Maria: Now, the moment she feared, the moment she eagerly waited for, was at hand.
Maria: Up-and-down shivers needled the skin of her back and neck.
Maria: Sweat filled the inside of her trembling leather gloves.
Maria: Taking three deep breaths and a short prayer, she stepped into the darkness.

Maria: She came to a point where the cave became slightly wider, and the ceiling much taller, 
Maria: so much so, that the light of her torch couldn't even reach it.
Maria: As her chest tightned, she drew Sear.
Maria: Any sign of shifting movement, any slight noise at the edge of earing, 
Maria: any wiff of decayed flesh, any pair of eyes glowing in the midst of the gloom,
Maria: her senses and muscles were ready to receive and respond, accordingly.
Maria: The trail ended abruptly.

Maria: As if in one moment the blood was steadily falling to the ground,
Maria: and in another it had suddenly stopped.
Maria: A deep, guttural snarl, almost mocking in tone, came from behind her.
Maria: And when she turned around, she saw Its two slitted yellow eyes,
Maria: both screaming silently for her blood and flesh.
Maria: She wasn't surprised.

Joao: Kali couldn't say if this rush of attacks had lasted 2 minutes or 2 hours.
Joao: When It stopped, Kali had the the entirety of her coat and trousers ripped and bloodied.
Joao: Her left shoulder was dislocated, so she couldn't move the arm dangling underneath it.
Joao: Sear was still in her right hand, though. The torch she held in her teeth.
Joao: But she knew her body couldn't take much more of this.
Joao: "Last chance," she thought to herself.
Joao: And with all of her strength and will pulling for her body, she charged at It.
Joao: Responding in tandem, It also charged at her in a bestial, galloping motion.
Joao: It was now or never.
Joao: Do or die.
