Joao: It was friday afternoon,
Joao: and the Thirsty Dog Bar was bursting with an excited buzz of cursing and laughter.
Joao: After an intense week of evaluations and classes,
Joao: many students felt the need for a bit of drunken comradery.
Joao: The one who was screaming and shouting the loudest was <b>Bruce</b>.
Maria: <b>Joe</b> and <b>Darius</b> were almost baffled by it.
Maria: Despite being the tallest of the three, and having an impressive athletic physique,
Maria: he was surprisingly prone to turn awkwardly shy and silent in public.
Joao: The "almost" in "almost baffled" comes from the fact that, for the past few days,
Joao: <b>Bruce</b> was acting in a completely different manner to his usual self,
Joao: so the present situation was just another example of it.

Joao: "And th-and then, and then, the guy and his girl, just like..." 
Joao: "Got run over by an invisible car!",
Joao: "AN! INVISIBLE! CAAAAAAAAAR!!!", 
Joao: Bruce shouted with an inebriated fascination, almost choking with laughing.
Joao: "They j-just spun through the air like Half-Life 2 ragdolls!"
Maria: "That Instagram video's fake, bruh,", inteviened <b>Darius</b>, 
Maria: albeit with a bemuzement clearly present in his face and voice.
Joao: "But, I mean, let's be honest here! It's a pretty decent fake out," 
Joao: <b>Joe</b> couldn't help pointing out.
Maria: "Yeah, those two that got hit must be hired mimes, or something,"
Maria: "to fly through the air because of an invisible car pfffft..."
Maria: And the three of them burst out laughing simultaneously.
Joao: As the clamour died down,
Joao: <b>Joe</b> felt truly relieved that the week was finally over.
Joao: The two exams he had in past five days, were,
Joao: for a lack of a better term, an absolute pain to study for.
Joao: especially the one he did that very same day.
Joao: He could finally get some decent shuteye, even if only for a couple of days.
Joao: Plus, he could be with Josie. 
Joao: That what he was looking forward to the most.

Maria: "Hey, do you guys want anything else from the bar?", asked <b>Darius</b>.
Joao: "Nah, I'll pass," <b>Joe</b> said, 
Joao: who was already three beers under and he didn't want to get anywhere beyond tipsy.
Joao: Bruce, however, asked for another beer. It would be his seventh.
Joao: "I'm thirsty today", he said, and his mouth twisted into a grin that,
Joao: even according with his "brand new" persona, stroke <b>Joe</b> as uncharacteristically odd.
Maria: For the first time since they came into the Thirsty Dog, their table,
Maria: and the whole bar for that matter, fell into a sort of unusual quiet.
<<wait 5>>
Joao: "Joe, uhm..." said <b>Bruce</b>, shattering the silence, and paused,
Joao: as if trying to fit the correct words into a speach puzzle in his tongue.
Joao: From across the table <b>Joe</b> found himself in a slightly nervous antecipation.
Joao: After a few seconds of thought, <b>Bruce</b> finally said what he wanted.
Joao: "You need to do something for me".

Maria: "Hmm... sure, sure. What is it?" <b>Joe</b> asked, on the edge of reluctance.
Joao: <b>Bruce</b> went again into silent thought.
Joao: His posture was now almost as if cold and distant.
Joao: "I need you to meet me in the alley behind the drug store in Cleveland Street, today."
Joao: "8:00 PM, sharp",
Joao: this last word accompanied with an audible tap on the table by his right index finger.
Maria: Despite being mildly confusion, <b>Joe</b> nodded affirmatively.
Maria: "O-Okay... I'll be sure to be there."
Joao: "Good."
Joao: "Be there."
Joao: "Oh, and there comes Darius," 
Joao: and a radiant smile returned to <b>Bruce</b>'s face.

Joao: As he entered the small appartment, he felt it was even more claustrophobic than usual.
Joao: Keeping the lights off and the window's blinds semi-opened,
Joao: <b>Joe</b> mindlessly hung the bloodied coat from the hanger on the back of the door.
Joao: He threw himself into the unmade bed, shoes on and everything.
Maria: As he was laying there, facing the partial gloom of the low, smudged ceiling,
Maria: he shut his eyes.
Maria: Sleep took over him.

Maria: <b>Joe</b> found himself stopping beneath a streetlamp, 
Maria: whose light was peridocally on-and-offing.
Joao: A black cat was sitting right in front of him, poised almost like a living statue
Joao: right at the edge of the ray of light coming from above,
Joao: its slim and elegant figure appearing and disappearing in tandem with the flickering above.
Maria: He stood there,
Maria: the hairs in his arms and back all prickled up
Maria: gazing at the animal's greenish yellow eyes for what seemed like an eternity.
Maria: An almost relaxing warm and gentle breeze flowed right between them.

Joao: A couple of hours later, <b>Joe</b> woke up.
Maria: He felt an uncontrolable urge to eat something.
Joao: Grabbing a couple of eggs from the fridge and a pan from the cabinet opposite,
Joao: he began scrambling them on the stove. He also fried some bacon.
Joao: His movements were robotic and instictive, 
Joao: almost as if he was on some sort of auto-pilot. 
Maria: Then, after clearing a space between the mess of papers on his desk,
Maria: he settled a plate with the eggs and bacon on it and began gulping them down.
Maria: Not even a minute had passed, and it was already empty.
Joao: <b>Joe</b> felt like he could swallow the entire universe.
Joao: He got up to see what else he could eat, when his phone started to ring.

Maria: <b>Josie</b> was the caller.
Maria: From head to toe, <b>Joe</b> suddenly grew heavily numb.
Maria: She was simultaneously the only and the last person he wanted to talk to right then.
Joao: He felt as if he was standing in the middle of a wire,
Joao: both ends of which were quickly burning away. 
Joao His head working a mile a minute when the ringing suddenly stopped.
Joao: <b>Joe</b> drew the heaviest of breaths. He felt like he was about to throw up.
Joao: All tension started seeping out from him. 
Maria: Then, like a razorwire through the air, through his mind, the phone suddenly rang again...
Maria: And, as if by some will of its own, his thumb accepted the call.

Maria: "Hey baby! I'm so sorry I'm calling you at 1 AM. Hope I didn't wake you..."
Joao: <b>Joe</b>'s mouth was completely dry, as if his throat was filled with sand.
Joao: "*cough* H-hey! *cough* Uhh-uh n-no, no, I-I was a-awake, don't w-worry 'bout it."
Maria: "Well... you do sound a bit drousy," she said with a warm giggle.
Maria: "I know the day was probably tough."
Joao: "..."
Maria: "Well, I'll be quick then," she said in a reassuring tone.
Maria: "I was just wondering if you wanted to grab breakfast with me tomorrow morning."
Maria: "We haven't done it in a while."
Joao: "U-uh... y-yeah, sure..." he managed to mumble out,
Joao: and then, in a more decisive manner, "yeah, let's do it."
Maria: "...Great, great! Uhh... then, let's meet at Mandy's at... 10:30. Okay?"
Joao: "...Yeah, okay. Sound-sounds good..."
Maria: "Cool. Now, get yourself a good night's rest. Can't wait to be with you tomorrow!"
Maria: "Love you, Joey!"
Joao: "L-love you too... I r-really do..."
Maria: She hung up, but not without audibly smiling first.
Maria: <b>Joe</b>, phone still in his tightned grip, layed himself down on the bed.
Maria: And he closed his eyes.

Joao: In the middle of the purpleish gloom of the alley,
Joao: <b>Joe</b> stood examining the graffiti scribbled on the dirty walls.
Joao: The day was rapidly giving away into night.
Maria: He was waiting for <b>Bruce</b> to arrive,
Maria: but he had no idea WHY he was even waiting in the first place. 
Joao: The reasons for this meeting were completely unknown to him.
Maria: <b>Joe</b> only knew that, for the past few weeks,
Maria: <b>Bruce</b> had been acting in a rather odd manner.
Joao: And this,
Joao: this meetup in a dirty, stinking alley, with the ever fading sunlight
Joao: was the cherry on top of the cake.

Joao: <b>Joe</b> was facing the dead-end of the alley when, all of a sudden,
Joao: he heard the sound of heavy footsteps rushing towards him. 
Joao: As soon as he turned around to see who it was,
Joao: a bludgeoning blow sent him spinning awkwardly into the ground,
Joao: such was the force thrown into it. 
Maria: For just a second, he completely lost all logical awareness of space and time.
<<wait 5>>
Maria: Then, through the corner of his eye, he saw <b>Bruce</b> hovering above him,
Maria: his fists clenched into an almost perceivable tightness,
Maria: and a face as if chizzled out of irate stone.
Maria: <b>Joe</b> didn't know why and didn't know how,
Maria: but he understood immediately the scenario he was in.

Joao: <b>Bruce</b>'s didn't utter a single word.
Joao: He bent over and, with his large grip,
Joao: raised <b>Joe</b> up by his hair,
Joao: the bitter breath of cigarretes burning the inside of his nostrils.
Maria: Then, as if by some animalistic instinct of self-defense,
Maria: <b>Joe</b> found himself picking up a brick off the floor, and...
Joao: *THUD*
Maria: <b>Bruce</b> fell heavily on his back,
Maria: with blood seeping out of the newly made crevice on the side of his head,
Maria: and tears welling up in his newly offset eyes, 
Maria: while a burst of strong spasms toke hold of his entire body.
Maria: Down on his knees, with a brick in a tight grip,
Maria: <b>Joe</b> remained completely immobile,
Maria: his eyes, unblinking, completely fixed on <b>Bruce</b>'s.
Joao: A few moments later, the twitching stopped. 
Joao: Everything went static...
Joao: except the red stream of blood.
